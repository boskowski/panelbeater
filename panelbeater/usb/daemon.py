"""Watch the Scan button over USB and scan when it is pressed.

Three things have to happen, and all three were hard-won:

  1. ARM THE PANEL. Without it the Scan button is greyed out and a press is not
     even reported. Arming is a `SETUP PROF INFO` write, subject 0x02,
     direction 0x10, carrying `current_user_id` -- 32 hex characters, NOT the
     16-character host_id used for network registration. Sending the 16-char
     one is accepted and does nothing.

  2. ANSWER PROMPTLY. A press opens a job and the scanner waits for the host.
     Answer within seconds and it scans; leave it and the job goes stale and
     the panel drops to "Error" until the ADF cover is cycled. Hence the 50ms
     poll: a press can be visible for as little as one poll.

  3. FINISH THE BATCH. When the feeder empties the panel sits on "Scanning..."
     forever. `OBJECT POSITION 31 02` moves it to the ADF-empty prompt, and
     `MODE SELECT` page 0x2c with byte 6 = 0x05 returns it to the profile
     screen. The obvious candidates -- f1 09, f1 04, e0, d6, 31 00, 31 04 --
     are all accepted and all do nothing.
