"""Scan on the iX1500 over USB, without SANE.

Why not SANE: it opens the scanner through libusb too, and only one process can
claim the interface. Shelling out to scanimage means releasing the device for the
whole scan -- blind to the Stop button, blind to errors, and "finished" has to be
inferred from a subprocess exit code. Doing the scan here keeps the connection.

Why not the vendor commands the network path uses: they are network-only.
Sending d5/d8/e9/d4 over USB gets Overflow on the first one and timeouts after,
so USB has to use standard SCSI, the way ScanSnap Home does. The consequence is
raw pixel data rather than the JPEG the network transport returns -- about 25MB
a side at 300dpi colour instead of 650KB -- so it is compressed here before
anything else touches it.

Sequence, taken from captures/scansnap_home/usb-fullbus.pcapng:

The two WRITE tables are replayed verbatim. They are a gamma ramp and something
similar; nothing depends on understanding them, so they are captured constants
until they need to change.
